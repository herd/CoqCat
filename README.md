# CoqCat

CoqCat is a formalization in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) of [axiomatic memory models](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/j.alglave/these.pdf). These models can already be designed, simulated and tested against real hardware using the tools of the [DIY Toolbox](http://diy.inria.fr).

The goal of this development is to formalize these memory models and to prove interesting properties about them.

## Installation

To compile the project, run `make`.

If you want to generate the documentation using coqdoc, run `make html`.
